# Diabetes-Prediction-Using-Naive-Bayes
We use Na√Øve Bayes  to predict fairly correctly from the data provided, the chances of a person being a diabetic or not. 

The model predicts the class label according to the features given.

Here we are classifying the dataset using Naive Bayes Classifier using Python's Scikit-learn package.

The classification has two phases,

1) a learning phase - classifier trains its model on a given dataset

2) the evaluation phase - it tests the classifier performance. 

Here, we are giving datas collected from different persons.

The details about all steps are clearly explained in the ppt.{mmkppt.pptx}
